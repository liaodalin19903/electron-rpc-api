Electron.js app with [electron-rpc-api](https://github.com/vladimiry/electron-rpc-api) module usage examples.

## Getting started

1. Run `yarn` console command to install the dependencies.
2. Run `yarn start` console command to build and start the app. It's recommended to use the same Node.js version that is bundled with Electron. Electron v3 comes with bundled Node.js v10.
